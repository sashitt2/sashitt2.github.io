== About me
I am a graduate student in the [http://www.ae.illinois.edu/ Aerospace Engineering Department] at [http://illinois.edu/ UIUC], pursuing a PhD under the guidance of [http://www.ae.illinois.edu/directory/profile/bodony Prof. Daniel Bodony].
I am also completing a Masters in [https://cs.illinois.edu/ Compuer Science] at UIUC under the guidance of [http://www.el-kebir.net/ Prof. Mohammed El-Kebir].
Prior to this, I graduated with a B.Tech in [http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/ Aerospace Engineering] from [http://www.iitb.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay], and was fortunate to have worked with [http://www.hypersonic-cfd.com/index.html Prof. Krishnendu Sinha] and [http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jola/ Prof. Johan Larsson] during my time there.

== Research
Broadly speaking, my current research interests lie in formulating and solving optimization and inference problems with biomedical/healthcare applications.
I especially prefer to work on problems that require a combination of ideas from mathematics and computer science.
