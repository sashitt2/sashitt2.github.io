== Software

== Cancer Phylogenetics

=== [https://github.com/elkebir-group/paction Paction]

Paction is a method to reconcile SNV and CNA clone proportions and trees for thesame tumor. The output is a set of tumor clones characterized by both SNVs and CNAs,the clone proportions and a comprehensive clone tree annotated with both SNV andCNA events.

== Doublet Detection

=== [https://github.com/elkebir-group/doubletD doubletD]

doubletD is an efficient doublet detector designed for scDNA-seq data. IncorporatingdoubletD in scDNA-seq analysis pipelines leads to more accurate results.

== Transcript Assembly

=== [https://github.com/elkebir-group/Jumper Jumper]

Jumper is a code that takes a bam file of RNA-seq reads and a Fasta file of the reference genome as input and reconstructs RNA transcripts and their abundances in the sample.

== Phylodynamics

=== [https://github.com/elkebir-group/TiTUS TiTUS]

TiTUS is a code that takes as input a timed pathogen phylogeny with leaves labelled by the host along with epidemiological data such as entry-removal times for the hosts and a contact map.
It counts and uniformly samples from the set of feasbile interval vertex labelings of the timed phylogeny that satisfy the direct transmission constraint while supporting a weak transmission bottleneck.

=== [https://github.com/elkebir-group/SharpTNI SharpTNI]

SharpTNI is a tool for counting and sampling solutions from the space of parsimonious transmission networks under a weak transmission bottleneck constraint.
This problem arises in phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of disease outbreaks.

== Data-driven Dynamics Modeling

=== [https://bitbucket.org/sashitt2/lrdmd/src/master lrDMD]

Low-rank dynamic mode decomposition (lrDMD) solves for a rank-constrained linear representation of the dynamical system for given series of data snapshots.
